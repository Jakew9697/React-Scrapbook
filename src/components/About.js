          I am a software developer, a Dog Father of 4, a Cat Father of 6..., a
          musician, and a loving boyfriend to my bestfriend and soulmate. She is
          actually the reason I started developing this webiste. See my
          girlfriend and I, we like to adventure, and we like to take our 4 dogs
          with us and jam pack our phones with photos and videos of our
          escapades so we can then print those photos off and build scrapbooks
          out of them. I built this tool not to replace our niche of traditional
          scrapbooking, but to expand it to a realm where our treasured memories
          cant be devoured by our rambunctious dogs! I hope you will find good
          use of this website and forever keep those special moments alive.
